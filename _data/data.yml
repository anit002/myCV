    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     I am a Researh Scholar at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
     Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur under the supervison of
     [Dr. Satrajit Ghosh](https://satcrypt.github.io/#) and [Dr. Dipanwita
     Roy Chowdhury](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~drc/). My research interest 
     focuses on many aspects of Cryptography and Security. Specifically, I am 
     interested in designing of provably secure "Non-Malleable Codes", security 
     analysis of "Symmetric Ciphers", "Private Set Intersection" and it's 
     application in "Secure Multiparty Computation" etc. My unique orchid id is 
     [0000-0002-9328-3673](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-3673) and the dblp computer science bibliography is [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/332/5647.html).

          Currently, I am pursuing my research under the supervision of [Dr. Satrajit Ghosh](https://satcrypt.github.io/#) and [Dr. Dipanwita
          Roy Chowdhury](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~drc/). I have worked in the area of Tampering Resilient Cryptography and design some provabily secure Non-malleable Codes (NMCs).
           Apart from that I have started how to reduce the computation and communication complexity of 2-party Private Set Intersection Protocol in an efficient way.
