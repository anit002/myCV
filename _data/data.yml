    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     I am a  Research Scholar  at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/),
     [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), co-advised by
      [Dr. Dipanwita Roy Chowdhury](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~drc/) and [Dr. Satrajit Ghosh](https://satcrypt.github.io/#). My research interest 
     focuses on various critical aspects of Cryptography and Security. Specifically, I am 
     interested in designing of provably secure <b>"Non-Malleable Codes"</b>, security 
     analysis of <b> "Symmetric Ciphers", "Private Set Intersection", "Private Set Union", "Private Information Retrieval" and it's 
     application in "Secure Multiparty Computation", etc </b>. My unique orchid id is 
     [0000-0002-9328-3673](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-3673) and the dblp computer science bibliography is [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/332/5647.html).

          Currently, I am pursuing my research under the supervision of  [Dr. Dipanwita
          Roy Chowdhury](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~drc/) and [Dr. Satrajit Ghosh](https://satcrypt.github.io/#). I have worked in the area of Tampering Resilient Cryptography and designed some provabily secure Non-malleable Codes (NMCs).
           Apart from that I have started how to reduce the computation and communication complexity of a two-party Private Set Intersection and Private Set Union Protocol in an efficient way.
