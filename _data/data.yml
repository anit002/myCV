    summary: |
     I am a Researh Scholar at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
     Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur under the supervison of
      [Dr. Dipanwita Roy Chowdhury](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~drc/) and [Dr. Satrajit Ghosh](https://satcrypt.github.io/#). My research interest 
     focuses on many aspects of Cryptography and Security. Specifically, I am 
     interested in designing of provably secure "Non-Malleable Codes", security 
     analysis of "Symmetric Ciphers", "Private Set Intersection" and it's 
     application in "Secure Multiparty Computation" etc. My unique orchid id is 
     [0000-0002-9328-3673](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-3673) and the dblp computer science bibliography is [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/332/5647.html).
